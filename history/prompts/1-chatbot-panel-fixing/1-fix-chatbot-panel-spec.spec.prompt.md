## Response snapshot

# Feature Specification: Fix Chatbot Panel Functionality

**Feature Branch**: `001-fix-chatbot-panel`
**Created**: 2025-12-10
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Solve the miss functioning of the chatbot to the docusaures ui the main miss functioning is when i click on chatbot button from ui the chat pannel didnt open. Solve it Quickly!"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Access Chatbot Panel (Priority: P1)

As a visitor browsing the Docusaurus documentation site, I want to be able to click the chatbot button and have the chat panel open so that I can interact with the AI assistant.

**Why this priority**: This is the critical functionality that's currently broken. Without this working, users cannot access the chatbot feature at all, making the entire chatbot integration useless.

**Independent Test**: When clicking the floating chatbot button, the chat panel should open and be visible to the user, allowing them to see the input area and conversation history.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am viewing any page on the Docusaurus documentation site, **When** I click the floating chatbot button in the bottom-left corner, **Then** the chatbot panel should open and be visible on the screen
2. **Given** I have clicked the chatbot button, **When** the panel opens, **Then** I should see the input field and any previous conversation history

---

### User Story 2 - Toggle Chat Panel (Priority: P2)

As a user who has opened the chat panel, I want to be able to close it by clicking the close button or the floating button again, so that I can continue browsing without the chat interface blocking content.

**Why this priority**: Once the panel opens (which is the primary issue), users should be able to manage the panel state to have a good UX.

**Independent Test**: The chat panel can be closed, and reopened, using appropriate UI controls.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the chat panel is open, **When** I click the close button on the panel, **Then** the panel should close and disappear from view
2. **Given** the chat panel is open, **When** I click the floating chat button again, **Then** the panel should close

### User Story 3 - Consistent Behavior Across Pages (Priority: P3)

As a user navigating through different pages of the documentation, I want the chatbot button to consistently open the panel on every page, so that I can access help whenever needed.

**Why this priority**: Ensures the functionality works properly across the entire site, not just on specific pages.

**Independent Test**: The chatbot functionality works consistently across multiple pages in the documentation site.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am on any documentation page, **When** I click the chatbot button, **Then** the chat panel should open consistently
2. **Given** I have navigated to a different page, **When** I click the chatbot button, **Then** the panel should open as expected

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the chat panel fails to render due to JavaScript errors?
- How does the system handle rapid clicking of the chat button?
- What occurs if multiple instances of the chat panel are somehow created?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST open the chat panel when the floating chatbot button is clicked
- **FR-002**: System MUST allow users to close the chat panel using the close button
- **FR-003**: System MUST maintain the open/closed state of the chat panel correctly
- **FR-004**: System MUST ensure the chatbot button is consistently available on all documentation pages
- **FR-005**: System MUST handle rapid clicking of the chat button without creating multiple panels or errors
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide visual feedback when the button is clicked (e.g., loading state if needed)

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **ChatPanelState**: Represents the current state of the chat panel (open, closed, minimized)
- **ChatButton**: Represents the floating button that controls the panel visibility

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Users can successfully open the chat panel by clicking the floating button on 100% of documentation pages
- **SC-002**: The chat panel opens within 500ms of clicking the floating button in 95% of attempts
- **SC-003**: The chat panel can be reliably opened and closed by users without errors
- **SC-004**: User satisfaction with chatbot accessibility improves (measured through feedback)

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Successfully created a comprehensive feature specification for fixing the chatbot panel functionality
- 🧪 Tests: Specification includes testable user stories and acceptance criteria
- 📁 Files: spec.md and requirements.md checklist created in the feature directory
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready for planning phase with `/sp.plan`
- 🧠 Reflection: The specification clearly defines the user scenarios, functional requirements, and success criteria for fixing the non-functional chatbot panel

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Proceed with planning phase
