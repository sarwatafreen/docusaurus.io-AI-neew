# Feature Specification: RAG Retrieval & Pipeline Validation

**Feature Branch**: `005-rag-retrieval-validation`
**Created**: 2025-12-14
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "## ✅ Spec 2: Retrieval & Pipeline Validation (Completed)

**Goal**
Retrieve stored embeddings from Qdrant Cloud and validate the end-to-end RAG retrieval pipeline.

**Scope**
- Query vectors from collection `as_embeddingone`
- Validate similarity search accuracy
- Ensure metadata integrity and content alignment

**Process**
1. Initialize Qdrant client (Cloud)
2. Generate query embedding via Cohere
3. Perform similarity search (top-k)
4. Validate returned chunks and metadata
5. Test edge cases and error handling

**Output**
- Correct, relevant chunks retrieved
- Metadata (URL, chunk_index) preserved
- Stable, repeatable retrieval results"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Validate RAG Retrieval Accuracy (Priority: P1)

As a developer, I want to validate that the RAG system retrieves relevant content chunks when given a query, so that I can ensure the system provides accurate and useful information to end users.

**Why this priority**: This is the core functionality of the RAG system - if retrieval doesn't work properly, the entire system fails to deliver value.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by executing similarity searches with various queries and verifying that returned chunks are semantically related to the query, delivering confidence in the retrieval pipeline.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a query text and initialized Qdrant client, **When** similarity search is performed against the `as_embeddingone` collection, **Then** the system returns the most semantically relevant content chunks with high similarity scores.

2. **Given** a query and vector embeddings in the collection, **When** the retrieval pipeline is executed, **Then** the system preserves original metadata (URL, chunk_index) and returns content that matches the query intent.

### User Story 2 - Test Pipeline Robustness (Priority: P2)

As a QA engineer, I want to validate the end-to-end RAG retrieval pipeline under various conditions, so that I can ensure the system works consistently across different scenarios and doesn't fail unexpectedly in production.

**Why this priority**: Ensures the system works consistently across different scenarios and doesn't fail unexpectedly in production.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by running the retrieval pipeline with different query types and verifying consistent, reliable results across all test cases.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a range of query types (simple, complex, ambiguous), **When** the retrieval pipeline processes each query, **Then** the system returns appropriate results without errors or crashes.

---

### User Story 3 - Verify Metadata Integrity (Priority: P3)

As a data engineer, I want to ensure that metadata associated with retrieved content remains intact and accurate, so that I can maintain trust in the system's ability to attribute and source information correctly.

**Why this priority**: Critical for maintaining data integrity and allowing users to trace information back to its original source.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by comparing metadata of retrieved chunks with original metadata in the vector database, ensuring no corruption or loss of attribution.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** content chunks with associated metadata in the vector database, **When** similarity search retrieves these chunks, **Then** all metadata fields (URL, chunk_index) remain intact and correctly attributed.

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a query is extremely dissimilar to all stored embeddings?
- How does the system handle malformed queries or queries with special characters?
- What occurs when the Qdrant service is temporarily unavailable during retrieval?
- How does the system behave when retrieving results for queries that match multiple unrelated topics?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST initialize a connection to the Qdrant Cloud service using provided credentials
- **FR-002**: System MUST generate vector embeddings for query text using Cohere's embedding service
- **FR-003**: System MUST perform similarity searches against the `as_embeddingone` collection in Qdrant
- **FR-004**: System MUST return top-k most relevant content chunks based on cosine similarity scores
- **FR-005**: System MUST preserve and return original metadata (URL, chunk_index) for each retrieved chunk
- **FR-006**: System MUST validate that retrieved chunks are semantically relevant to the input query
- **FR-007**: System MUST handle query processing errors gracefully and return appropriate error messages
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide configurable top-k values for similarity search results

### Key Entities

- **Query**: The input text that needs to be matched against stored embeddings for retrieval
- **Embedding Vector**: Numerical representation of text content used for similarity comparison
- **Content Chunk**: Segments of original documents that are stored as vectors in the Qdrant collection
- **Metadata**: Associated information (URL, chunk_index) that provides context and attribution for retrieved content

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Retrieval system achieves 90% semantic relevance accuracy when validated against sample queries
- **SC-002**: Pipeline completes similarity search and returns results within 2 seconds for 95% of queries
- **SC-003**: 100% of retrieved content chunks maintain their original metadata integrity (URL, chunk_index)
- **SC-004**: System successfully handles 99% of varied query types without errors during validation testing
