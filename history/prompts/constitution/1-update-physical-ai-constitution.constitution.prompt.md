# Update Physical AI Constitution

## Prompt

```
/sp.constitution
Project: Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook
Define standards for accuracy, ethics, and reproducibility.  
Use primary sources, APA citations, zero plagiarism, and rigorous fact-checking.  
Ensure clarity for CS students (grade 10–12).  
Emphasize interdisciplinary input from AI, robotics, biomechanics, cognition, and ethics.  
Require ethical AI principles: safety, fairness, privacy, transparency, and accountability.  
Mandate robustness & safety engineering, with risk assessment and testing.  
Highlight intuitive, culturally aware human-robot interaction design.  
Support continuous learning, adaptation, and real-world improvement.  
Technical standards: simulation-first, ROS 2, Isaac, hardware–software co-design.  
Workflow: iterative, hypothesis-driven, peer-reviewed, and fully reproducible.
```

## Response

The constitution for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook project has been created with the following details:

### Core Principles:
1. Academic Accuracy and Integrity
2. Interdisciplinary Collaboration
3. Ethical AI Principles
4. Robustness and Safety
5. Human-Centered Design
6. Technical Excellence

### Additional Sections:
- Technical Constraints
- Development Workflow
- Governance

### Version Information:
- Version: 1.0.0
- Ratified: 2025-12-06
- Last Amended: 2025-12-06

The constitution was created based on the user-provided specifications and follows the required template structure, replacing all placeholder values with project-specific content. The file includes a Sync Impact Report at the top, and all dependent templates were checked for consistency (none required updates).

## Outcome

Successfully created and updated the project constitution at `.specify/memory/constitution.md` with the new specific principles and guidelines for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook project.
