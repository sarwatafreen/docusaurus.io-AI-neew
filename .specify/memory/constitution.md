- **Beginner-Friendly:** All content must be written in a clear, accessible manner, assuming no prior expert knowledge of the subject.
- **Spec-Driven Development:** The book's structure and content will be developed using the Spec-Kit Plus methodology to ensure clarity, consistency, and a well-defined scope.
- **Open Source:** The entire book, including all code and content, will be open-sourced to encourage community contributions and feedback.

### Success Criteria
- The completed book is successfully built and deployed as a Docusaurus site on GitHub Pages.
- The project receives positive feedback from the target audience of beginner to intermediate learners.
- The project serves as a practical example of using Spec-Kit Plus for a real-world project.

### Constraints
- **Technology Stack:** The project must use Docusaurus for documentation and website generation.
- **Methodology:** The project must adhere to the Spec-Kit Plus framework for specification, planning, and task management.
- **Deployment:** The final output must be deployable to GitHub Pages.

### Stakeholders
- **Authors:** The primary creators and maintainers of the book content.
- **Readers:** The target audience, consisting of developers and students with a beginner to intermediate skill level.
- **Contributors:** Community members who provide feedback, corrections, or new content.

### Brand Voice
